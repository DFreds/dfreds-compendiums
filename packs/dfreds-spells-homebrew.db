Creatures who fail their save reduce their speed by half until the end of their next turn, and objects weighing less than 100 pounds that aren't being worn or carried are pushed back 15 feet away from the point at the center of the effect.</p><p>Wood.

Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the hand clamps across the creature's mouth.

Removing the hand requires a Strength (Athletics) check using your spell save DC. At your command (no action required), the hand releases the target and returns to your side.</p><p><i><b>Slapping Hand.</b></i> The hand flies to a creature of your choice you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the hand slaps the target.
