Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those students who survived.</p><p>Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.</p><div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2323\" > <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cat</span></span> <p>Styles that employ a sword belong to this family.

In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p><p>At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.</p><table class=\" stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Tempest Domain Spells</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Cleric Level</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\" >Spells</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\"  >1st</td><td class=\"col-10\"  ><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#fog%20cloud_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;mZkzwS0ZS7Z8QakQ&quot;}\">fog cloud</a>, <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#thunderwave_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;BFMTj3NIgkGz7VG5&quot;}\">thunderwave</a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\"  >3rd</td><td class=\"col-10\"  ><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#gust%20of%20wind_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;G4gXmT75DNs9S5o4&quot;}\">gust of wind</a>, <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#shatter_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;kBnxLjyzhbmSGF9n&quot;}\">shatter</a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\"  >5th</td><td class=\"col-10\"  ><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#call%20lightning_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;sC9HtINF4svLfH4q&quot;}\">call lightning</a>, <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#sleet%20storm_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;1MvSlujzvx6TRz5U&quot;}\">sleet storm</a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\"  >7th</td><td class=\"col-10\"  ><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#control%20water_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;AJRfEdgxwZfTctMe&quot;}\">control water</a>, <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#ice%20storm_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;hJ8HfOYfULx0smLs&quot;}\">ice storm</a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\"  >9th</td><td class=\"col-10\"  ><a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#destructive%20wave_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;ywQXLLeIQ37dpk2Z&quot;}\">destructive wave</a>, <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#insect%20plague_phb\"   data-plutonium-actor-sheet-item=\"{&quot;actorId&quot;:&quot;1sv6txFfM6jp7qLE&quot;,&quot;itemId&quot;:&quot;XBA9K7XIaarMjlXu&quot;}\">insect plague</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 62","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null},"consume":{"type":null,"target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"requirements":"Cleric 1 (Tempest)","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false},"flags":{"srd5e":{"dataType":"subclassFeature","className":"Cleric","subclassName":"Tempest Domain"}}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/plutonium/media/icon/mighty-force.svg","effects":[],"_id":"JWULUvWJKz2cho7C"}
