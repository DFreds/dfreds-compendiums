Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.&nbsp;For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Replacing the Book</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Copying a Spell into the Book</strong></p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.&nbsp;For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\"><strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\">Replacing the Book</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.

You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column in the table below, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n<p><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">**Foundry note: Note the limited uses is set to the base default of 2.

When describing your spellcasting, think about how you&rsquo;re using a tool to perform the spell effect. If you cast cure wounds using alchemist&rsquo;s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker&rsquo;s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. When you cast poison spray, you could fling foul chemicals or use a wand that spits venom. The effect of the spell is the same as for a spellcaster of any other class, but your method of spellcasting is special.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The same principle applies when you prepare your spells. As an artificer, you don&rsquo;t study a spellbook or pray to prepare your spells. Instead, you work with your tools and create the specialized items you&rsquo;ll use to produce your effects. If you replace cure wounds with heat metal, you might be altering the device you use to heal&mdash;perhaps modifying a tool so that it channels heat instead of healing energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Such details don&rsquo;t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell&rsquo;s effects. You don&rsquo;t have to justify how you&rsquo;re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h5 id=\"SpellcastingAbility\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill.

As a result, you have gained the ability to cast spells.

You must have a spellcasting focus&mdash;specifically [item]thieves' tools;thieves&rsquo; tools[/item] or some kind of artisan&rsquo;s tool&mdash;in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature. You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See chapter 5, &ldquo;<a title=\"Equipment\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment\">Equipment</a>,&rdquo; in the <em><a title=\"Player&rsquo;s Handbook\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb\">Player&rsquo;s Handbook</a></em> for descriptions of these tools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"Cantrips0LevelSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of&nbsp;the spell&rsquo;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the <a style=\"color: #704cd9;\" title=\"artificer spell list\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=252717\">artificer spell list</a>. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&rsquo;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

The spring after his 8th birthday Flann's parents went on a tour with the troupe from which none of them returned. From what Flann was told they were travelling as part of a good will mission into neighboring territory. Knowing his parent's generous ways Flann never questioned whether the story told to him by Mitchums was true. Flann obviously knew a lot about his parent's musical ability and was already quite good at the lute himself. What Mitchums revealed to him was their secret lives as thieves who, along with their troupe, would use their vocation as a cover for stealing from rich people and giving to the poor. With Mitchums guidance Flann was soon doing some of this work locally around Waterdeep. Before his 20th birthday Flann had quite a reputation as a noble vigilante, always on the side of the downtrodden. Flann also wasn't stupid. The rising number of Xanathar goons was giving him pause and upon talking to Mitchums they decided to take the missions totally underground. Flann would focus on bringing in money through his musical abilities while Mitchums would still work through the underground looking for ways to diversify that didn't step on the Xanathar's toes. At least not directly. One night Flann discovers he can influence the fight happening during his performance. That night they make out very well and somehow no one has any idea. One thing leads to another and after a few trial fighters Flann and Mitchums meet Mutt, a bugbear of some prowess and highly influenceable.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Chaotic Good","race":"Satyr","background":"Urchin","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14000,"pct":0},"appearance":"<p>Age: 43</p>\n<p>Sex: Male</p>\n<p>Height: 4'11''</p>\n<p>Weight: 140</p>\n<p>Hair: Salt 'n' Pepper</p>\n<p>Eyes: Brown</p>\n<p>Skin: White</p>","trait":"<p>Has purposefully kept his speaking and singing voices distinct to be able to roam the world as anonymous as a satyr can.
